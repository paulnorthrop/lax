Description: Performs adjusted inferences using fitted model objects 
    returned from the extreme value analysis packages 
    'evd' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evd>, 
    'evir' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evir>, 
    'extRemes' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=extRemes>, 
    'fExtremes' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=fExtremes>, 
    'ismev' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ismev>, 
    'POT' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=POT>, 
    'texmex' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=texmex>, 
    ...
    Adjusted standard errors and an adjusted loglikelihood are provided, using    
    the 'chandwich' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=chandwich>
    and the object-oriented features of the  
    'sandwich' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=sandwich>.
    The adjustment is based on a robust sandwich estimator of the parameter 
    covariance matrix, based on the methodology in Chandler and Bate (2007) 
    <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>. This can be used for cluster correlated data 
    when interest lies in the parameters of the marginal distributions or for 
    performing inferences that are robust to certain types of model 
    misspecification.  
    Currently only univariate extreme value models are supported.
    As a byproduct, generic S3 logLik, coef, vcov and nobs methods are 
    provided, where these are not already provided in the original package.
